        IMPORTANT POINTS
- recursion= a function that can call itself
- while the function is not finished executing it will remain in stack memory
- when the function finishes executing it is removed from the stack and the flow of program restores back to where it was called
- in order to stop the function we require a base condition, without it, we will end up in stack overflow error
- any complex problem can first be solved using recursion then can be optimized by iterations
- space complexity not constant
